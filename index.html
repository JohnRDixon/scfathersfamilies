                We at the South Carolina Center for Fathers and Families believe that children thrive when an engaged, responsible father is active in their lives. Yet, in South Carolina many children live in a father-absent home and the consequences are dire for these children. To address this growing problem, The Center supports six fatherhood programs in 12 communities across the state while promoting father-friendly policies and practices and helping to erase society's negative stereotypes of unwed, low-income dads. Few programs have the expertise to deliver father-centered programs to enable men to develop the knowledge, confidence and skills to become responsible fathers and co-parents. The SC Center for Fathers and Families and tthe local fatherhood programs have this extensive experience.
