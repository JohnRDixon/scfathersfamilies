            <h2>Fatherhood Programs</h2>

            <p> 
                Fatherhood Programs are thoughtfully created to deliver services that work from the inside out, helping fathers prepare to meet the material, emotional and spiritual needs of their children. They no longer have to go it alone because our fatherhood programs can help.

                The Center for Fathers and Families works with six local fatherhood programs in 11 locations to deliver quality, father-friendly services throughout South Carolina.  See below for a complete listing and contact information for each of these programs.

                        It is our mission to help low-income, noncustodial fathers become engaged as a positive, productive and stable part of their children's lives. While fathers are often looked upon as the source of strength for the family, we realize that they often need help as well. The Father to Father Project, Inc., is here to provide that support.
