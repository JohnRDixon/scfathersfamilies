            <h2>Fathers &amp; Families</h2>
            <p>
                Being a father is not easy; however, it is the single most important job in the lives of men who have children. The challenges of being a responsible father sometimes seem too difficult and there's no place to turn for help. If you, or someone you know, needs help to better provide for your children and yourself, a fatherhood program can help.

                <h4>Navigating Child Support</h4>

                <p>
                    Navigating the child support system presents many challenges for low-income, non-custodial fathers.  Check out these tips for navigating the system:
                </p>
                 
                <h5>Establish paternity.</h5>
                <p>Attend every child support hearing regarding your case.</p>

                <h5>Pay something even when you can not pay the full amount.</h5>
                <p>Document payments and keep receipts of purchases requested by the mother and paid on your child’s behalf.</p>

                <h5>Keep a record of dates and times when you did and did not work and the reasons why.</h5>
                <p>Keep copies of all documents from DSS, Family Court, a Clerk of Court, Attorney or the mother regarding child support and visitation.</p>

                <h5>Do not ignore official correspondence.</h5>
                <p>Contact DSS if you believe you are being harassed by a private child support collection agency.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="visitation">
                <h4>Obtaining Visitation</h4>

                <p>
                    Legal paternity is the legal connection between father and child and is the premise for every parental right that a parent has including the right to seek visitation and/or custody.  So before pursuing legal visitation, an unwed father must establish legal paternity.  Spending consistent, quality time with your child is an important part of being a responsible father.  Even so, sometimes the child’s mother will not allow visitation for the father.  There are practical, legal steps to take to help improve visitation:

                    If you have a strained relationship with the mother, seek help to improve communication skills
                    Pay your child support.  It is more difficult to obtain visitation rights when child support payments are not up-to-date.

                    Arrange for a safe and child-friendly environment in which to spend time with your child.
                    In addition to practical steps, there are <a href="#">legal steps for obtaining visitation.</a>
